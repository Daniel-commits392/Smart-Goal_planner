# ðŸ§  Smart Goal Planner (React Project)

Welcome to my first React project! I built a Smart Goal Planner where you can:

- Add goals
-  View them in a list
-  Delete goals if you're done with them


##  What This Project Does

This app helps you stay organized by tracking your goals.  
You can add things like:

- Goal name
- Target (what you want to achieve)
- Deadline
- Your current progress


##  How It Works

This app is built using **React**, which lets you break the UI into small, reusable **components**.

Here are the main parts:
`App`: The main file that connects everything |
 `GoalList`: Shows the list of goals and the add form |
 `GoalForm`: A form where you type in your goal details |
 `Information`: Displays more info about each goal |

##  Tools Used

- React (for building the UI)
- JSON Server (as a fake database)
- Fetch API (to get and send data)
- useState & useEffect (React hooks to manage data and side effects)



##  How To Run It

1. **Start the backend server**:

npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3000

2. **Start the frontend React app**:
   Use: npm run dev
   
4. **Open your browser**
    You will see a link once you **run npm run dev**. This link will take you to the browser where you will see the application.
